                We all want to believe in life after death and imagine loved ones looking over us,
                feel their presence in a draft of air, or the faint essence of a familiar smell.
                It's what we crave, knowing they wait for us. But Jack isn't waiting -
                they won't leave him alone. Some might call Jack a troubled soul, at odds with the world,
                unable to conform. If you saw him in the pub - disheveled and drunk, talking to himself -
                you'd stay well away, think he was disturbed somehow, crazy. But Jack has a sharp mind
                and a razor wit. It's not that he doesn't want to live a normal life, he can't.
            </p>
            <p>
                They won't let him.
            </p>
